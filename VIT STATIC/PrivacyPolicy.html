  <div class="header">

    <ol>
      <li><strong>VIT (Victorian Institute of Technology)</strong> has adopted the Australian government’s National Privacy Principles as the basis for its policy on information collection, storage and access. This policy sets out our policy
        regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data to us.</li>
      <li><strong>What information we collect and why we collect the information?</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>VIT collects personal information for the conduct of its business. That information may be obtained directly from staff and students, from corporate customers, or through a third party who we believe has informed you that your details
            may be provided to us. VIT will only store personal details if they are relevant to our business. We do not normally obtain or store information that is deemed by the Privacy Act to be sensitive information.</li>
          <li>We store personal information predominantly to ensure that we can maintain contact with our staff, students, customers and suppliers. This contact may be verbal, electronic or written. The reason for the contact may be to inform,
            request assistance or to maintain a relationship.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>How do we collect the information?</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Where practical, VIT will only collect information directly from you. If we collect it from another source, we will do what is reasonably possible to inform you that we have collected the information.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>How do we store personal information?</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Your information is held either in paper-based records or in electronic form in computer databases. VIT takes proper precautions to ensure the security of that information.</li>
          <li>If information is no longer needed, VIT will either delete it from our systems or de-identify it, so that it cannot be attributed personally, unless retention of the same is required to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements or to
            protect our interests or in accordance with our policies. If a credit card is used to pay fees, details of that credit card are only retained for the purpose of that particular transaction.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>When do we use this information? </strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Information collected will only be used when necessary for the conduct of our business and our relationship with our staff, students, customers and suppliers. Information gathered by VIT in one instance may be used in another instance
            unless it is expressly denied.</li>
          <li>We will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of the personal information, and only authorised staff have access to your personal data and all authorised staff are required to abide by their contractual obligations
            to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of your personal data at all times.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>To whom will we disclose your information?</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>We do not normally disclose your personal information to third parties. In the event that we may be required to share your personal data with any third party, we will notify you beforehand and obtain your consent. We do not disclose
            credit card details to anyone and we do not sell any personal data in our possession to anyone or any third party for any purpose. We will only disclose your personal data in circumstances that you have expressly or implicitly consented
            to, or deemed to have consented to; that have been specifically notified to you; are necessary for the operation of our business; or otherwise only in limited circumstances such as to government departments, statutory boards, regulatory
            or law enforcement agencies or in accordance with the applicable laws.</li>
          <li>Your personal data may be disclosed to third parties as necessary to facilitate any of the above purposes and/or in the following ways: to third party consultants who may from time to time manage our database or systems; to third
            parties where we outsource any of our functions, including but not limited to development, marketing and campaigns; during an incidental sale of all or part of our business to prospective purchasers and their legal and accounting
            representatives; and as required by law.</li>
          <li>For Students: There are some circumstances in which personal information about students may be shared between the VIT and the Australian Government and designated authorities and, if relevant, the Tuition Assurance Service and the ESOS
            Assurance Fund Manager. This information includes personal and contact details, course enrolment details and changes, and the circumstance of any suspected breach by the student of a student visa condition. Information about students will
            be treated as confidential, but may be made available to Commonwealth and State agencies, as required by regulations/law. The personal contact details of the students may also be shared with the Debt recovery agencies for recovery of dues
            the student owes to VIT in case of default of tuition fee payments. Students may access their personal information at any time by writing to the CEO of the VIT and by providing appropriate evidence of identity in accordance with our
            privacy policy.
            <ol>
              <li>VIT is required to inform the Department of Home Affairs about:
